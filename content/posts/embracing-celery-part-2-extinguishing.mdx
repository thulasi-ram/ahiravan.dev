This post works upon internal library kombu used by celery for amqp transport mechanisms. For people that are not a option visit blog one where we [extend the functionality of celery](/blog/embracing-celery-part-1-extending)

1. Gotchas of celery
	1. celery events gossip
	2. celery canvas large payloads
	3. The code
	4. Metadata celery uses
	5. Unintutive defaults

2. But I want resilience of celery
3. dead letter queues !!!
4. But but but where are my retries and delayed tasks?

## History
* Started of as a simple script to implement celery via gevent here https://gist.github.com/thulasi-ram/6f0a867e8303047a76cb0d2b56af8de4
* Then evolved to a gist here with basic structure: https://gist.github.com/thulasi-ram/3c166f587a3df69af8aaccb4f2449db5
* Then to a full blown library packaged in github here: https://github.com/thulasi-ram/kombu-rabbitmq

One can down download the code as zip and include in their lib. Perhaps someday will make a pip package out of it.
Sneak peek of examples for django and flask as below.

## Django Example
```python
import os
import sys

import django

from rabbitmq.django import Rabbitmq, handle_db_conn_close
from rabbitmq.utils import maybe_jsonify

rmq = Rabbitmq()

my_exchange = rmq.E('my-exchange', 'topic')

my_queue = rmq.Q(
    queue_name='my-queue',
    routing_key='#',
    exchange=my_exchange,
)


@maybe_jsonify
@handle_db_conn_close
def process_message(body, message):
    print(body, message)


def main():
    rmq.publish(my_queue, {"hi": "there"})

    rmq.consume(
        callback=process_message,
        queue=my_queue,
        enable_retries=False
    )


if __name__ == '__main__':
    os.environ.setdefault('DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE', 'myapp.config.settings')
    django.setup()
    sys.exit(main() or 0)
```


## Flask Example
```python
import os
import sys


from rabbitmq.flask import Rabbitmq
from rabbitmq.utils import maybe_jsonify

rmq = Rabbitmq()

my_exchange = rmq.E('my-exchange', 'topic')

my_queue = rmq.Q(
    queue_name='my-queue',
    routing_key='#',
    exchange=my_exchange,
)


@maybe_jsonify
def process_message(body, message):
    print(body, message)


def main():
    rmq.publish(my_queue, {"hi": "there"})

    rmq.consume(
        callback=process_message,
        queue=my_queue,
        enable_retries=False
    )


if __name__ == '__main__':
    os.environ.setdefault('DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE', 'myapp.config.settings')
    from flask import current_app
    rmq.init_app(current_app)
    sys.exit(main() or 0)
```
