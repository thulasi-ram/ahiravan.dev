## PDF generations in python

Popular Libraries for Generation PDFs
* [wkhtmltopdf](https://wkhtmltopdf.org/)
* [reportlab](https://www.reportlab.com/)
* [weasyprint](https://weasyprint.org/)

The above ones are one of the most used libraries but they lack the portability, ease of installation in our case
unable to render css properly. When our frontend guys took to rendering the invoices in html none of the above libraries
could render the css properly. We had to put wierd hacks and polyfills for them to work and occasionally one would render
out of proportion / borders. Apparently maintaining responsiveness with wierd hacks and polyfills is not a very easy task.

But we had to generate lots of pdfs and merge them sometimes. And then comes along [django-hardcopy](https://github.com/loftylabs/django-hardcopy)
which was able to leverage headless chrome into rendering and saving the resultant pdf. But we were on flask but with docker deployments ensuring chrome being always present we quickly hacked together a small helper
and to our astonishment the css rendering was pixel perfect. 

It had some drawabacks though, somethings could not be done in headless which could otherwise be done in
wkhtmltopdf or weasyprint. But we didnt need to learn another library, we didnt need to set page sizes and fonts. We did not need to explain to a frontend dev why his
centering css wont work or why the flex wont wrap properly. Most important of all as most folks wont have it, it was perfect in every way for our use case.


## Ramblings much. Where code?
