# IDs and Prefixes

## Rationale

* We have observed bad cache hit ratio in TS transactions table due to uuid v4s as primary identifiers
  * the btree index takes a hit when range queries are done
  * The inserts are slower because a different page has to be written
  * And in general caused postgres to read many pages from disk
  * <https://uuid6.github.io/uuid6-ietf-draft/> - IETF rationale for a new uuid v6 type
  * <https://brandur.org/nanoglyphs/026-ids> - Comparisons of different types in a primary key
  * <https://github.com/tvondra/sequential-uuids>


* There are also cases where the ids different entities are swappable and do not contain any context leading to vague communication and manual errors. To prevent this we adopt a format popularized by stripe by prefixing ids
  * <https://clerk.dev/blog/generating-sortable-stripe-like-ids-with-segment-ksuids>
  * We also want to avoid confusion around new user_id being an uuid which can be confused for khata user_id and vice versa

    \


* Taking into consideration above, our ids can become more friendly to humans and caches alike by following format
  * **<prefix>_<random string>**
  * Examples:
    * *ord_0ujsswThIGTUYm2K8FjOOfXtY1K*
    * *pr_0ujsszwN8NRY24YaXiTIE2VWDTS*
    * us_0ujsszgFvbiEr7CDgE3z8MAUPFt

## Prefixes


:::info
The below prefixes are not finalized as of now and subject to change

:::

* `ord_` for oms orders
* `ln_` for order line items
* `rfo_` for refund orders /  returns
* `us_` for new users store
* `pa_` for payments
* `sh_` for shipments
* `pr_`for oms products
* `ct_`for oms categories


### Random String Considerations

* The string must be random enough to prevent collisions
* Use a library than rolling out your own
* Make sure the string has a good cache locality
* We prefer [KSUID](https://github.com/segmentio/ksuid) for now, [uuidv6/v7/v8](https://uuid6.github.io/uuid6-ietf-draft/) can also be used instead


### Storage

* Use varchar type in postgres
  * <https://github.com/segmentio/ksuid/issues/23>
  * Ideally the length will be within 30-40 chars but in postgres there’s no difference
  * ref: <https://dba.stackexchange.com/a/126047/229241>
* Postgres doesn’t seem to have an optimization of UUIDs
  * <https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25595069>


### Why not ULIDs

* ULIDs have millisecond precision compared with Ksuid 1 second precision
* Has compatibility with 16 bytes uuid vs 20 bytes ksuid
* <https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25594657>
* <https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24646018>
* <https://github.com/segmentio/ksuid/issues/8>
* In general UUID spec can be interpreted subjectively and has foot guns. ksuid spec seems to have been thought better
